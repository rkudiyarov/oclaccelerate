Requirements: Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), 6.10.1 or later

Standard Cabal installation:

  % runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=INSTALLPATH
  % runhaskell Setup.hs build
  % runhaskell Setup.hs install
    OR
    runhaskell Setup.hs install -- user

Then, to use the library, pass the flag "-package accelerate" to GHC.

WARNING: This is at best an *alpha* release.  The library isn't actually useful
	 for anything at this stage, except for people interested in writing
	 a backend.  The API is also guaranteed to going to change a few 
	 more times before settling down.  You have been warned.
	
Direct questions at Manuel M T Chakravarty <chak@cse.unsw.edu.au>
(aka ChilliX on #haskell and friends).
